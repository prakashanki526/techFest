The Department started to offer 2 years Certificate Course in Servicing and Maintenance of Medical Equipments (CSMM) and Certificate Course in Maintenance of Electrical Equipment (CMEE) in its initial years. The department started to offer 3 years degree course (B.E. in Instrumentation and Control Engineering) in the year 1993. Later on in year 2009, the department started to offer postgraduate program i.e. M.Tech in Instrumentation and Control Engineering (ICE). The department started to offer 4 years undergraduate programs i.e. B.E. in Electrical Engineering (GEE) and B.E. in Instrumentation Engineering (GIN) in the year 2014. Currently, the department of EIE is offering 3 years diploma courses in Electrical Engineering and Instrumentation & Control Engineering, two 4 years undergraduate programs i.e.  B.E. in Electrical Engineering and B.E. in Instrumentation Engineering, one postgraduate program i.e. M.Tech in Instrumentation & Control Engineering and doctoral programs covering most of the research areas related to Electrical and Instrumentation Engineering.
